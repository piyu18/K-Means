# K-Means Clustering: A Centroid based Algorithm
K — means clustering is a centroid-based unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Unsupervised learning uses the machine learning algorithm to analyze unlabelled data and find hidden patterns without human intervention. It’s clear from the name itself that K-means is a cluster-based algorithm.
